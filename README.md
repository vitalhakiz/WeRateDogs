# WeRateDogs
The WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10 and the numerators almost always greater than 10. The goal of this project: Wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations by gathering data, then assessing and cleaning it to get better analyses.
